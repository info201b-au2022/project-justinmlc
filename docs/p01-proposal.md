## Abstract
The main question is embedded into the title of this project; _**just how impactful is sleep for a college student?**_ This question is important because for the lives of many students, healthy sleep is not a high priority to them and in most cases is often neglected. To address the question, we will look into datasets that provide insightful information about students’ grades, health, and overall well-being in correlation to their sleeping habits.

## Keywords
* Mental Health
* Sleep deprivation
* Subjective sleep quality
* University students

## Introduction
Sleep deprivation is common amongst university students who live in a culture that promotes reduced sleep, due to the burden of academic work and social pursuits. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness are caused by a host of reasons and have numerous negative consequences. Some of the reasons for poor sleep hygiene include alcohol and caffeine intake, stimulants, and technology, which prevent students achieving sufficient sleep time and quality. Sleep deprivation is often termed either acute sleep deprivation or chronic partial sleep deprivation. Acute sleep deprivation is termed “pulling an all-nighter”, meaning that a person stays up for 24 hours or longer. More typically, sleep deprivation consists of chronic partial sleep deprivation, where a student obtains some, but **not adequate** sleep. A cross-sectional survey found that 71% of students did not achieve the recommended 8 h of sleep, with 60% classified as poor sleepers. While many studies have investigated the effects of sleep deprivation, few focus on university students, despite the prevalence and impact of sleep deprivation in this population. This project is aimed to show how a night of sleep deprivation, equivalent to an “all-nighter”, would have a negative impact on the motor and cognitive performance of students.


## Problem Domain
* As our title suggests, our topic focuses on the _**impact of sleep on college students**_, which is exactly what we are concerned about as college students. "According to the National Sleep Foundation, high school students (ages 14 to 17) need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night. For young adults (ages 18 to 25), this range requires 7 to 9 hours"[(Hirshkowitz, 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2014.12.010) However, most college students are getting far less than the recommended amount of sleep. "70 to 96 percent of college students get less than eight hours of sleep per week at night. More than half of college students get less than seven hours of sleep per night"[(Ryan, 2022)](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/school-and-sleep/final-exams-and-sleep) This lack of sleep often has a negative impact on their **academic performance, physical and mental health, and overall well-being**. Our project aims to explore the extent to which sleep affects college students by collecting relevant data sets.

* In the past few years, Covid-19 has been a global pandemic that has had a significant impact on people, including college students. Due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, during that time, most universities switched their class mode to remote, which also had an impact on college students' sleep and grades. Meanwhile, some college students experience mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. We are curious to know if this is related to the general lack of sleep time among college students. Therefore, in the project, we will use relevant data sets to analyze the relationship between sleep and performance during the online learning mode of college students, as well as the association between college students' mental health and sleep.

* The direct stakeholders are college students and the indirect stakeholders are professors and universities.

* The **possible harms** of sleep deprivation may include fatigue, irritability, short temper, difficulty coping with stress, and difficulty concentrating and remembering. These can have a negative impact on the quality of life of college students as well as on their performance. In addition, chronic sleep deprivation can have serious negative effects on physical and mental health. "College students who **prioritize sleep** may see improvements in their academic performance, be more productive, more attentive to detail, and be able to concentrate better while studying."[(Harvard Summer School, 2021)](https://summer.harvard.edu/blog/why-you-should-make-a-good-nights-sleep-a-priority/)

* This project demonstrates the relevance of human well-being, which is related to the **quality of life**. Through this project, we hope that college students can pay more attention to their sleep and promote healthy sleep to reduce the negative effects associated with sleep.


## Research Questions
1. "Does longer duration of studying lead to a higher GPA"

**Explanation:** This question is important because it shapes the entirety of our research. The datasets we collected involve these topics and it is important to figure out the relationship. This research could help out these college students and find a way to be able to better their learning experience and potentially further their grade.

2. What is the relationship between sleep duration and fear of COVID-19 for university students for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic?

**Explanation:** Specifically during the pandemic, online learning was very tiring and overwhelming for many students. Diving deeper into the study can help show how much of a toll this adjustment played on the students.

3. How does sleep duration and quality impact university students’ academic performance?

**Explanation:** Hopefully after analyzing this data, students can better learn how to be able to have a balance of both sleep and school. Alongside that, how teachers and school curriculum can allow students to function properly and not assign too much work.


## The Dataset
* The data that we have gathered all connect through one important aspect: Amount of sleep. We can use these connections to find the correlations between mental health, academic performance, and overall happiness and well-being of students.

Below is a table presenting all of the data files that we have gathered:

1. The data for the first observation was provided by a user on Kaggle by the name of "Nabila" A specific date of creation for the data was not specified, but the author states that it was made in 2022. The author collected this data to make a *statistical study* on student academic performance, which will allow others to make predictions based off a set of student records. With that being said, there was no notations or marks that this data collection was funded. One way this data collection was deemed credible was through *Kaggle's'* Usability score of 9.41, which represents the level of documentation for the dataset. We found this data through the website *Kaggle*, which was provided to us as a potential dataset-finding website.
2. The data for the second observation was provided by Jakki Seshapanpu and was created for the purpose of "understanding the influence of the parents background, test preparation, etc, on students performance." The effort was not funded and also has a high *Kaggle* Usability score to validate its credibility. Data was found through *Kaggle*.
3. The data for third observation was provided by many people associated with the Harvard Dataverse. The aim of the study was to "explore the relationship between different mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and fear of COVID-19, with subjective sleep quality." Again, no evidence of funding was found for this dataset. We found this dataset to be credible due to its abundance in documentation and it having a License/Data Use Agreement. We found this using *Google Dataset Search*.
4. The data for the fourth observation was provided by Marina L. Zochil and Einar Thorsteinsson in 2016. It aimed to examine moderating effects of sleep quality with help-seeking intention. No source of funding was found for this effort. We found it credible through its high quality documentation, and found the data through *Google Dataset Search*.


## Expected Implications
Sleep deprivation has significant effects. Sleep-deprived professionals struggle to maintain task focus, engagement, and participation in activities deemed non-essential. Heavy industry, airlines, and companies with a large number of shift workers have been aware of the dangers of sleep deprivation for a long time. The relationship between employee alertness and workplace accidents, errors, and injuries is strong. But the risks extend *far beyond* industrial workers to salaried or "white collar" employees as well. When employees are fatigued, communication becomes difficult. It can result in a lack of strategic direction and poor judgment when communicating complex ideas and directions. Sleep deprivation can significantly affect a leader's personality and the surrounding organizations.

## Limitations ?????????????????????????????????????????????
1. One limitation of our data is that one of the studies, "Exploring poor sleep, mental health, and help‐seeking intention in university students, Australian Journal of Psychology", has an over representation of women. With 98 out of the 117 subjects being women, it limited the study and its generalization. The study suggested that next time, they could try and balance this number out.
2. The second limitation of our data is that one of the studies, "Student Study Performance", was **not clearly labeled and hard to interpret**. For example, the study has a column labeled, "Your sleep hour. How long a student sleep throughout the week?" Then, with the data ranging from 5-8. It can be seen as confusing as it is not normal for a person to get 8 hours of sleep during a whole week. It also is not clear whether or not that is the average amount of hours per sleep in a week.
