## Abstract
The main question is embedded into the title of this project; _**just how impactful is sleep for a college student?**_ This question is important because for the lives of many students, healthy sleep is not a high priority to them and in most cases is often neglected. To address the question, we will look into datasets that provide insightful information about students’ grades, health, and overall well-being in correlation to their sleeping habits.

## Introduction
Sleep deprivation is common amongst university students who live in a culture that promotes reduced sleep, due to the burden of academic work and social pursuits. Sleep deprivation and sleepiness are caused by a host of reasons and have numerous negative consequences. Some of the reasons for poor sleep hygiene include alcohol and caffeine intake, stimulants, and technology, which prevent students achieving sufficient sleep time and quality.  sleep deprivation is often termed either acute sleep deprivation or chronic partial sleep deprivation. acute sleep deprivation is termed “pulling an all-nighter”, meaning that a person stays up for 24 hours or longer. More typically, sleep deprivation consists of chronic partial sleep deprivation, where a student obtains some, but not adequate sleep. A cross-sectional survey found that 71% of students did not achieve the recommended 8 h of sleep, with 60% classified as poor sleepers. While many studies have investigated the effects of sleep deprivation, few focus on university students, despite the prevalence and impact of sleep deprivation in this population. This project is aimed to show how a night of sleep deprivation, equivalent to an “all-nighter”, would have a negative impact on the motor and cognitive performance of students.


## Research Questions
1. How does mental health and the quality of sleep correlate among university students?
2. What is the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance for university students for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic?
3. How does sleep duration and quality impact university students’ academic performance?

# Problem Domain


## The Dataset
The data that we have gathered all connect through one important aspect: Amount of sleep. We can use these connections to find the correlations between mental health, academic performance, and overall happiness and well-being of students. 

Below is a table presenting all of the data files that we have gathered:

1. The data for the first observation was provided by a user on Kaggle by the name of "Nabila" A specific date of creation for the data was not specified, but the author states that it was made in 2022. The author collected this data to make a "statistical study" on student academic performance, which will allow others to make predictions based off a set of student records. With that being said, there was no notations or marks that this data collection was funded. One way this data collection was deemed credible was through Kaggle's Usability score of 9.41, which represents the level of documentation for the dataset. We found this data through the website Kaggle, which was provided to us as a potential dataset-finding website.
2. The data for the second observation was provided by Jakki Seshapanpu and was created for the purpose of "understanding the influence of the parents background, test preparation, etc, on students performance." The effort was not funded and also has a high Kaggle Usability score to validate its credibility. Data was found through Kaggle.
3. The data for third observation was provided by many people associated with the Harvard Dataverse. The aim of the study was to "explore the relationship between different mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and fear of COVID-19, with subjective sleep quality." Again, no evidence of funding was found for this dataset. We found this dataset to be credible due to its abundance in documentation and it having a License/Data Use Agreement. We found this using Google Dataset Search.
4. The data for the fourth observation was provided by Marina L. Zochil and Einar Thorsteinsson in 2016. It aimed to examine moderating effects of sleep quality with help-seeking intention. No source of funding was found for this effort. We found it credible through its high quality documentation, and found the data through Google Dataset Search.
