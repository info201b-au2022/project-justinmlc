## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/ChartForQuestion1.R")
plot(chart1)
min_study_hr <- find_min_studyhr()
```

This bar chart is in correspodance to our first research question *"Does longer duration of studying lead to a higher GPA"* This visualization was included in order to find a correspondence between a person's GPA and the time they spend studying. According to our findings, it appears that time spent studying has no real correlation to school performance GPA-wise. For example, the minimum time someone has spent studying is `r min_study_hr`, but the students with that amount of study time on average do not have the lowest GPAs.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("../source/ChartForQuestion3.R")
plot(chart3)
max_avg_sleep <- find_max_avg_sleep()
```

This bar chart is in correspondence to our third research question: *"How does sleep duration and quality impact university studentsâ€™ academic performance?"* This visualization was included to display the cumulative GPA of students in correlation to the average amount of sleep they would get. We observed that as the amount of sleep a student got decreased, so did their cumulative GPA. A notable observation is that even solely considering the highest GPAs, the average amount of sleep a student got was only `r max_avg_sleep` hours, which is below the widely-recommended **8** hours of sleep.
